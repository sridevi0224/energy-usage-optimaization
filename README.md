🔋 Energy Usage Optimization

📘 Introduction

Energy consumption is a critical concern in today’s world, where sustainability and efficiency are paramount. With the advent of smart meters and IoT-based monitoring, there's a growing need to analyze energy usage patterns to optimize consumption, reduce costs, and contribute to environmental sustainability. This project aims to analyze and optimize energy usage using data-driven techniques.

🎯 Objective The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze historical energy usage data.

To identify patterns, anomalies, and high-consumption periods.

To build a predictive model that forecasts future energy consumption.

To recommend strategies for energy usage optimization based on model insights.

📊 Dataset The dataset used in this project includes:

Timestamped energy consumption records.

Features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and other environmental factors that influence energy usage.

The dataset is typically structured with columns like:

Date

Energy_Usage (kWh)

Temperature

Humidity

Wind_Speed

Visibility

etc.

🛠️ Technologies Used This project leverages several technologies and tools:

Python – core programming language

Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for machine learning models (regression, clustering)

Jupyter Notebook – for code execution and documentation

📈 Visualizations Various visualizations are used to understand the data and present insights:

Line plots of energy consumption over time

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Histograms and box plots to study distributions

Scatter plots for feature vs. consumption relationships

Feature importance plots from machine learning models

⚙️ How to Use

1.Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

2.Install dependencies using pip

3.Load the dataset (ensure the file path is correctly set in the notebook).

4.Run cells sequentially to preprocess, visualize, and model the data.

5.Analyze outputs including predictions and optimization insights.

6.Experiment with new models or tuning hyperparameters to improve performance.
